erofs-utils uses two different license patterns:

 - most liberofs files in `lib` and `include` directories
   use GPL-2.0+ OR Apache-2.0 dual license;

 - all other files use GPL-2.0+ license, unless
   explicitly stated otherwise.

Relevant licenses can be found in the LICENSES directory.

This model is selected to emphasize that
files in `lib` and `include` directory are designed to be included into
3rd-party applications, while all other files, are intended to be used
"as is", as part of their intended scenarios, with no intention to
support 3rd-party integration use cases.
